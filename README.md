# Vesit-Placement-Record-System
In the proposed system the administrators can view and approve the records in less time. Placement officers and administrators can easily collect studentsâ€™ details provided by them. Here administrators can also search for the details provided by the students on the basis of percentage. Administrators can also see the statistical data of students placed in companies year wise and branch wise.

The system has four modules : 

-Admin Module: Admin can login through admin module. Admin need not register himself/herself. The admin will be getting a username and password through which they can login. They have the authority to make changes in the records.

-Company Module: company Module shows the company details.

-Student Module: The student module stores student details and their placement status which can be modified or deleted as and when required.

-Statistical Module: The statistical module uses the pictorial representation to display the statistics of students placed in a particular company in the form of a bar graph.
